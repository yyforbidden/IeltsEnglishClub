Welcome to join us!

We are self-organized groups to achieve progress, on English and emigration. 

We encourage mutual help + focus on delivering results, and forbid advertisment and personal attack, which help us build long-lasting friendship even after the exam and emigration.  

Examiner tips/ member experience will be shared via this wechat number and our sina weibo @IELTS English Club, which is more categorized. You can also join our QQ groups for discussion. We have 4 groups now, and you can take the one 181088790.
